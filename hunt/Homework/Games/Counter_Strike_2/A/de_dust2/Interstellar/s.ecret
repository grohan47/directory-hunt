I can’t write this in my journal. I don’t even trust that anymore. What if someone’s been reading it? What if that’s how they know exactly what to say to break me? No… this stays here. Hidden. Safe.

Aarav…
I’ve never meant anything to him. Not as a friend, not even as a person. Just someone he tolerates because he has to. But why does he hate me so much? I can feel it in every look, every sarcastic remark, every time he cuts me off mid-sentence like I don’t even deserve to be heard.

He doesn’t act this way with others. He laughs with Monish, casually throws an arm around Tarun, acts like life is some big joke. But with me? It’s different. Colder. Sharper. Why this partiality? What have I done?

Tarun…
I used to think we were close. But now? It’s like I don’t exist. We share a room, but it feels like I live alone. He’s always there but never present. Headphones on, lost in his own world, until he suddenly decides to acknowledge me—with some offhand sarcastic remark that cuts more than he realizes. Or maybe… he does realize.

With others, he’s normal. Joking with Monish. Debating with Aarav. Chatting with Umesha. It’s just me he avoids.

Why? What changed? What did I do?
