echo "In the labyrinth of blurred realities and half-remembered dreams,
a singular path emerges—a journey where gravity loses its grip.
When the weight of the world fades and the cosmic horizon calls,
the haunting strains of Zimmer’s score echo through the void.
Let his music be your guide as you follow the trail where time dissolves
and only the starlight reveals the way beyond the familiar."
